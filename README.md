#### **Brief Introduction**
This is a quantitative finance project assigned as part of the QF2103 Computing for Quantitative Finance course in AY 23/24, Semester 2.

It aims to provide a comprehensive analysis on the research on 2 different trading strategies, using Python as a computational tool, and explores the application of machine learning techniques to develop and enhance trading strategies. Specifically, this research focuses on two key strategies: local extrema identification and mean reversion analysis, both using logistic regression as the machine learning model.


The research aims to contribute to the field of quantitative finance by providing practical insights and methodologies for building effective trading strategies using machine learning techniques.


The stock data used can be obtained from the first five stocks in tr_eikon_eod_data.csv, named AAPL.O, MSFT.O, INTC.O, AMZN.O, and GS.N. The completed codes for this research can be found in Trading_Strategies_Analysis_Codes.ipynb, along with code-specific instructions and observations. The report is a detailed analysis on the application of the two strategies with the machine learning model.
